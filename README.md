index.html(main page): For this page I created/included the following:

Navbar: made this toggleable when screen is smaller, included navbar brand that will take you back to the homepage when clicked. 

Carousel: Used various images for this and created some text for each slide.

Order online Button: Created this button which will take you to the order page when clicked.

Call button: created this button so you can call the number once clicked.

OrderPage.html: For this I created the following:

Navbar: same as on the homepage

Containers, rows and columns: created a order page using these elements, a row for each item, columns for description, price and add to cart.

Add to cart button: when this is clicked 1 item is added to the cart, if the same item is clicked twice an alert will pop up advising it's already added to the cart. The quantity increase is included in the cart for this project.

Add to cart button: when clicked the item is added, if same item clicked twice an alet will advise it's already added. The item name, price and quantity is added to the cart.

Cart: for the cart I have created some JavaScript which will ensure the overall total increases when an item is added to cart or if the quantty of the item is increased. I have included a remove button which will remove the item in the carts row and overall total will be updated accordingly. When the proceed to checkout button is clicked it will take you to a payment page.

paymentPage.html: For this page I created the following:

Collection/Delivery Selection: when collection is selected only the payment card info is visible, when the delivery is selected it will bring up input fields for address entry. I have a complete purchase button which needs to have an onclick function created for form validation as this project is still WIP.

I decided to make a modal payment section rather than a new page. so all PaymentPage docs were kept for reference.

Started creating a function for form validation via javascript, however this is not particulary how I want it to work so decided to take 5 and change the styling of my form.

Added success/failure icons next to each input field within my form, added styling so the icons are hidden.
